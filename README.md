# qv (quick view): a viewer for 2D data (images, renderings, sensor data, ...)

qv shows images and image-like data and provides analysis tools such as
statistics, histogram, range selection, and color maps.

It is useful for all kinds of 2D data from sensors, simulation, rendering, or
high dynamic range imaging.

qv requires Qt and [tad](https://marlam.de/tad).
